Progress Video

Before the week starting, i didn't had any idea about websites.I was a person who scrolls down several websites,and never ever tried or looked up to it to create one. I believed that it is not possible by me to do that, and thought that it was all done by great professionals.

But when i got the first week task only i looked up to it and referred few videos to complete the task.I felt so confident when i did one of it.And also posting it on the GitHub was also completely new to me.It was so interesting to do that,Hope i can continue   doing each week's task.
